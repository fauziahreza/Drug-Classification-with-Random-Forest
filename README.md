# Drug Classification with Random Forest - Streamlit App
This repository contains code and data for the Drug Classification project, which uses the Random Forest algorithm to classify drugs into different categories based on their properties. The project follows the CRISP DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to ensure a systematic and well-structured approach to solving the problem.

## Streamlit App
We have deployed the drug classification model as a Streamlit web application. The app allows users to input the chemical properties of a drug, and the model will classify it into the appropriate therapeutic category.

## How to Run the Streamlit App
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/fauziahreza/Drug-Classification-with-Random-Forest.git
- Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
- Navigate to the app directory: cd app
- Run the Streamlit app: streamlit run app.py
- The app should be running locally on http://localhost:8501/.

## App Features
- Input Form: Users can input the chemical properties of a drug through a user-friendly form.
- Classification Result: The app will display the predicted therapeutic category of the drug based on the Random Forest model.
- Easy to Use: The app provides an intuitive interface, making it simple for users to get classification results.

## Repository Contents
- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks showcasing the step-by-step process of data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- `streamlit/`: Contains the Streamlit web application code.

## Getting Started
Follow the steps mentioned above to run the Streamlit app locally on your machine.

## Conclusion
By applying the CRISP DM methodology, we successfully developed a drug classification model using Random Forest and deployed it as a user-friendly Streamlit web application. This app can assist pharmaceutical researchers and practitioners in quickly identifying the therapeutic category of drugs based on their chemical properties.

Let's build an accurate and reliable drug classification model together! Happy coding!
